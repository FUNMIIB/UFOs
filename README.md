# UFOs

**Project Overview**

This project utilizes JavaScript as the coding language. JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to improve webpages by enhancing the user experience. Javascript enhances websites by providing front-end functionality, customization, dashboards (such as maps or graphs), and allows for user input to create dynamic web pages. Javascript enables websites to be visually appealing and interactive.

In this project, I built on the module repository by updating the table we created in the module which organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and was created using JavaScript as the primary coding language. 

I also created filters to make the table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and I then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. I then customize the webpage using Bootstrap, and equiped the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with my visualizations.

**Coding Methods**

In this project
- We built and deployed JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
- Converted JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
- Built and deployed forEach (JavaScript for loop).
- Created, populated, and dynamically filtered the table using JavaScript and HTML (convert a Javascript array into an HTML Table)

Project Deliverables
Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

**Results**

I created a user-friendly webpage that display UFO sighting data with a filter table that allows users to easily filter on various criteria. The criteria includes date, city, state, and shape. The webpage view when unfiltered is shown below:
